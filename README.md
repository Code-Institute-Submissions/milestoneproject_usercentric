# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project - The Beach Boys

The website was designed to promote the 60's band the Beachboys and their return to performing. The website aims to provide new and old fans with 
with a little bit of information about the members. The website offers a sound clip that lets users listen to some of the beachboys greatest hits
as well as a video clip for one of thier videos. Finally the website also promotes that the Beachboys are avilable to take bookings for events
by providing the user an option to submit thier contact details for the band to get in touch and arrange further details about the booking. 

The overall aim is to have an easy to navigate website that was designed desktop first to enable users to find out about who the Beachboys are
and book the band for an event. 


# UX

The UX has been designed for desktop first with the aim of making it easy for all users ot navigate and access the content they want.

I have provided a number of user stories below: 

* As a user who has not heard of the Beachboys before I want to be able to find out about the band members

* As a user who has not heard of the Beachboys before I want to be able to listen to some of thier music

* As a user who is a fan of the Beachboys before I want to be able to listen to some of thier music

* As a user who is a fan of the Beachboys before I want to be able to book the Beachboys for a wedding/christmas party/ event

* As a desktop user I want to be able to navigate the website easily so I and find the information i want with ease

* As a mobile user I want to be able to navigate the website easily so I and find the information i want with ease

* As a fan  I want to be able to navigate to be able to find thier social media pages so I can follow them on social media

* I have also included some mock ups for the initial planning phase of the website



# Features

The navigation bar allows users to navigate to any page without needing to use the back button. 
This feature is clear and users should be able to navigate around the website with ease. 

The media.html page has an audio clip and a video clip that the user can watch at thier own leisure. 
The lay out is clear and it is easy to navigate to. 

The user can book the Beachboys for an event by filling in the form on the contact.html page 
The user can input details to submit to the band to enable them to contact the user to discuss the finer details of the booking. 

the footer provides links to the contact page and the social media links of the band that lets users quiuckly open up a new window or tab 
with the bands other web pages. 


# Technologies used

* used HTML5 and CSS3

* bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/
used bootstrap primarily for the grid system

* cdnjs - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hover.css/2.3.1/css/hover-min.css
used this to apply the hover to aspects of the website

* google fonts - https://fonts.google.com 
used google fonts to apply fonts to the text within the website

# Testing

I completed much of my testing as I built the website up. 

I started with the index.html page and  put together the header and logo- this consisted of multiples tests to ensure
the logo and the text of the header did not push what is essentially the navigation bar out of line from desktop - mobile. 
as i changed font size and padding I needed to amend them accordingly as the header came out of line with the logo and the nav bar. 

makking sure the hover sweep to bottom didnt extend past the bottom of the the header into the main section was an issue I struggled with 
however after changing the padding and the height I eventually manged to get it to fit the sixe of the box in the nava bar. 

I had tested all the links on the header to ensure each page links to the other pages. 

the footer was the next thing that was put in place which I initially had problems with  the columns and the text all being to the left however
after using the grid method I was able to have 3 seperate columns which split across the page. 

initially I left the social media links blank however towards the end of the project 
I put these in and realised not all the social media links were not appropriate for this particular band.
I also found throughout my research that the beachboys had thier own website which I then incorperated as an extra link. 


The about page had issue when resizing the screen from desktop to mobile the text would overlap the picture and it was not clear or professional.
I eventually realised this was an issue with my rows and columns and amended them accordingly which then in turn allowed me to restructure
the whole page so there was more screen real estate being utilised  rather than having everything down the center. 

I tested this regularly as I input different picures and texts to ensure the the transisiton from desktop to mobile was smooth
and looked professiona, I also asked my peers to see if the website had an issue when they used it. 

The media page was tested in a similar way to ensure the media played smoothly when clicking play and there was no issure when resizing the screen.
intially I had problems with the screen window not showing the full video as though it was zoomed in on one part of the video, 
I resolved this by testing the html and css by trial and error to ensure the size of the screen was responsive to the web page 
regardless of its size. 

the contact page was tested by resizing the screen to ensure all the input fields and the labels resized appropriatly which was not the case
initially. To start with some of the labels would move and sit above the input fields however this was rectified with the columns being tweaekd.
the next part of testing was on the inputform  to ensure the user could only put the correct type of information into the correct field. 

The CSS across the whole site has been amended on a number of ocassions. 
I had issued with giving things elemnts 100% width however this then over ruled other elements. I then amended this by butting my rows in a wrapper
to enable me to apply color schemes across the main section of each pagerather than targeting every row.

Gernealy speaking I had issued with my grid system with some confusuin around the rows and columns  where by i was putting a row within a row 
which was causing the background not to cover the width of the row  or justfill a column  and leave the other columns blank. Once I 
had got a better understanding I went though all my web pages to ensure hte rows and coulmns were all in place to make it much clearer and enable
more efficient management of each page.
