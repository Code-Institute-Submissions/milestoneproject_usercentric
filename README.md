Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need 
that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. 
Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, 
explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.

User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project - The Beach Boys

The website was designed to promote the 60's band the Beachboys and their return to performing. The website aims to provide new and old fans with 
with a little bit of information about the members. The website offers a sound clip that lets users listen to some of the beachboys greatest hits
as well as a video clip for one of thier videos. Finally the website also promotes that the Beachboys are avilable to take bookings for events
by providing the user an option to submit thier contact details for the band to get in touch and arrange further details about the booking.

The overall aim is to have an easy to navigate website that was designed desktop first to enable users to find out about who the Beachboys are
and book the band for an event.


UX

The UX has been designed for desktop first with the aim of making it easy for all users ot navigate and access the content they want.

I have provided a number of user stories below:

As a user who has not heard of the Beachboys before I want to be able to find out about the band members

As a user who is a fan of the Beachboys before I want to be able to listen to some of thier music

As a user who is a fan of the Beachboys before I want to be able to book the Beachboys for a wedding/christmas party/ event

As a desktop user I want to be able to navigate the website easily so I and find the information i want with ease

As a mobile user I want to be able to navigate the website easily so I and find the information i want with ease

As a fan  I want to be able to navigate to be able to find thier social media pages so I can follow them on social media


I have also included some mock ups for the initial planning phase of the website

Features

The navigation bar allows users to navigate to any page without needing to use the back button. 
This feature is clear and users should be able to navigate around the website with ease.

The media.html page has an audio clip and a video clip that the user can watch at thier own leisure. 
The lay out is clear and it is easy to navigate to.

The user can book the Beachboys for an event by filling in the form on the contact.html page 
The user can input details to submit to the band to enable them to contact the user to discuss the finer details of the booking

the footer provides links to the contact page and the social media links of the band that lets users quiuckly open up a new window/ tab 
with the bands other web pages.


Technologies used

used HTML5 and CSS3

bootstrap - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/
used bootstrap primarily for the grid system

cdnjs - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hover.css/2.3.1/css/hover-min.css
used this to apply the hover to aspects of the website

google fonts - https://fonts.google.com 
used google fonts to apply fonts to the text within the website

Testing

I completed much of my testing as I built the website up.

I started with the index.html page and  put together the header and logo- this consisted of multiples tests to ensure
the logo and the text of the header did not push what is essentially the navigation bar out of line from desktop - mobile. 
as i changed font size and padding I needed to amend them accordingly as the header came out of line with the logo and the nav bar.

makking sure the hover sweep to bottom didnt extend past the bottom of the the header into the main section was an issue I struggled with 
however after changing the padding and the height I eventually manged to get it to fit the sixe of the box in the nava bar.

I had tested all the links on the header to ensure each page links to the other pages.

the footer was the next thing that was put in place which I initially had problems with  the columns and the text all being to the left however
after using the grid method I was able to have 3 seperate columns which split across the page.

initially I left the social media links blank however towards the end of the project 
I put these in and realised not all the social media links were not appropriate for this particular band.
I also found throughout my research that the beachboys had thier own website which I then incorperated as an extra link.
